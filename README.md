You can follow the mirror articles to do it manually, the script is intended to reduce the steps to deploy and get many more light clients set up on various devices.

Light clients perform Data Availability Sampling (DAS) which enables Celestia to scale the DA layer. since each light node only samples a small portion of the block data, more light nodes the more data the network can collectively download and store.
