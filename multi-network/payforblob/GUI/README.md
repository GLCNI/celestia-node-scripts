# UI for PayForBlob Transactions
This uses some parts of the PayForBlob auto scripts in the parent folder to create a easy user interface for manually submitting PFB transactions with button interactions or setting a automated PFB Tx routine to run in the background.

this application is for use with `multi-client` deployment scripts, though it is for use with `celestia-node` (data availability â€“ light or full-storage) other install methods might require some manual configuration.

## How to Install
### 1. Install Script 
Easiest way to run the UI, no setup required. Requires Celestia-node installed and running, full storage or light node, and funded with enough gas for submitting PFB Txs.

**pfb-ui script functions**

- select API interface (`Gateway API` or `RPC API` )

- downloads all dependancies to run the UI (`python3` `pip` `flask` )

- downloads all files needed to run UI

- downloads binary for generating either hex or base64 encoded random data

**Download script**
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GLCNI/celestia-node-scripts/main/multi-network/payforblob/GUI/pfb-ui.sh && chmod a+x pfb-ui.sh
```

**Run Script**
```
./pfb-ui.sh
```
Select API Method (gateway or RPC API), script will download all files for the UI based on API method, then check and download dependancies
